Retool
Technical Account Manager, San Francisco

Dear Retool Technical Account Manager Team,

I am excited to learn that Retool is growing the sales engineering team with the Technical Account Manager (TAM) position shared on LinkedIn. The prospect of ensuring the technical success of Retool’s most strategic accounts sounds like the perfect opportunity to contribute and develop my skills and interests in software development innovation. Given my current role, in which I speak daily with companies of all sizes who lack the resources to build the necessary tools, I deeply believe in Retool’s mission to bring good software to everyone. I am someone with strong commercial instincts but also who enjoys technology and engineering, and I am confident that the team will find my experience, skills, and work ethic to be an excellent match for the Technical Account Manager role at Retool.

Currently, on the New Business team at Plaid, I lead 20+ consultative meetings per week with customers to uncover their business needs and discuss how Plaid can be a strong fit for them. Throughout these calls, I demo Plaid’s API-based solutions via sample apps, documentation, and videos, field technical and business questions, and gather information on relevant stakeholders, budgets, and timelines, as I partner with account executives and managers to set up the success for the rest of the sales process. When speaking with a prominent Plaid persona, developers, I see their backend development and tech stack, and I resolve any questions or bugs as they start building, like a missing product feature, certain institutions or endpoints not working properly, or providing suggestions for implementation. To supplement and deepen my technical knowledge gained on the job and my studies in data and computer science, I resourcefully study and leverage our API documentation, internal and external forums, and product training. I also work directly with even more technical folks like Technical Account Managers, Sales Engineers, Product Managers, and Engineers. Product knowledge is a core part of my role, and I strive to make this level of product knowledge accessible and repeatable across the team. Specifically, I work with our Revenue Enablement team to create the schedule and content of training for the team around our newly launched products. This deep product expertise and instinct to build new programs has helped me be the highest performer on the team and uplevel my peers, which would positively impact my customers’ experiences and the TAM team at large. 

While working on my data science capstone project with external client NBCUniversal, I led a team composed of a software engineer and two data analysts to build a machine learning (ML) model to predict employee engagement in the post-COVID era and deliver a final report and presentation on our findings. Throughout this process, I outlined the project goals and roadmap, coordinated schedules to secure stakeholder attendance and engagement during weekly meetings, managed external communication with stakeholders, and led feedback and debugging sessions on the ML model with the engineer and analysts. We successfully delivered significant findings and recommendations to help NBCU positively impact employee engagement. This product and project management experience helped me hone my technical skills as well as stakeholder management skills while ensuring progress toward outcomes, which directly transfer to my potential responsibilities as a TAM. 

With my skills and experience in consultative, technical customer conversations and process improvement, I believe I will be able to drive revenue and customer success at Retool. Thank you for your time and consideration of my application. I hope to have the opportunity to speak with you in the near future about my passion for working at Retool.

Sincerely,

# Sophie de Castro
